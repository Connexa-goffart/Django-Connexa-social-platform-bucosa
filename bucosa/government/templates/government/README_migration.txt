# Bucosa Government App Template Migration
#
# As of July 2025, the following templates have been consolidated into a single-page app:
# - `bucosa.html` (main and only template)
#
# The following templates are now obsolete and can be deleted:
# - about.html
# - contact.html
# - detail.html
# - history.html
# - index.html
# - main.html
# - manage_join_requests.html
# - registration.html
# - request_join.html
#
# All logic and UI are now handled in `bucosa.html`. If you need to restore any old template, refer to version control history.

# main.html is now the root template for the government app, using bucosa.html as the base.
# index.html is deprecated and should be removed.
